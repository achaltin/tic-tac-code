# Tic-Tac-Code

This code was developed as a beginner's python workshop for the 2019 Code.Chi conference. The complete code is included, but for workshop purposes, omit parts as necessary. If you reuse my code, please credit me by displaying the link to my [website](http://ameliachaltin.com): ameliachaltin.com. You may also copy, modify, and use my [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZvGFuBn0QQQAZJctD4DGW-IDkkoC4NU-JY2guh6-VZ4/edit?usp=sharing) with credit. Have fun!

## Recommended Workshops

| Code to Implement  | Workshop Settings |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| generate_computer_move  | For a short or beginner's workshop, just implement the computer's turn  |
| generate_computer_move, prompt_player_move  | For a longer beginner's workshop, implement the computer and player turns  |
| generate_computer_move, prompt_player_move, is_winner, playGame | For an intermediate workshop, implement the turns, winner logic, and the gameplay |
| all stub methods (except display_board) | for a longer, advanced workshop, provide only skeleton code. Work through some of the code with the students, then let them work independently. This workshop would be best for students with experience, and several hours or days. To make shorter, provide more methods to begin with. |

## Presenting Workshops

Be mindful of the student ability levels and time constraints. Ideally, students should have a finished product by the time the workshop ends. You will also need to include some time to explain the code that exists and the necessary functions, as well as any software setup, so plan accordingly.

If laptops are provided to the students, make sure they are configured with some form of python notebooks. Personally, I use Jupyter Notebooks. If students bring their own laptops, you may give them the option to download software, but don't require it. In this case, uploading your code to dropbox or similar sharing sites and then using a [web based notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb) would be best. You can also export the notebook to a .py file, and allow students to work with python on their machine or in an [online python environment](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler).
